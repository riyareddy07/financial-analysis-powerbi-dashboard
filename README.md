# Power BI Financial Analysis Dashboard

This project provides an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to analyze financial performance, including **sales, profit, orders, and discount trends** across different segments, countries, and products. The dashboard is built using **Power BI** with **DAX calculations** and **Time Intelligence functions** for advanced insights.

## Data Preprocessing

To ensure data quality and accurate analysis, the following preprocessing steps were performed:
- ** Data Cleaning:** Transposed data for better visualization, removed unwanted missing rows and columns.
- ** Data Profiling:** Identified **anomalies, missing values, duplicates, and null values** in Power BI.
- ** Data Transformation:** Applied **DAX calculations** for financial KPIs and trend analysis.

## Data Analytics Methods

###  1. Anomaly Detection
- ** Irregularities detected in sales and profit data across segments.**
- ** Unusual fluctuations in order volumes and discount applications.**

####  DAX Calculation for Anomaly Detection
```DAX
Anomaly Detection = 
VAR MeanSales = AVERAGE('Financial Sample'[Sales Amount])
VAR StdDevSales = STDEV.P('Financial Sample'[Sales Amount])
VAR UpperBound = MeanSales + (2 * StdDevSales)
VAR LowerBound = MeanSales - (2 * StdDevSales)
RETURN 
    IF(
        'Financial Sample'[Sales Amount] > UpperBound || 'Financial Sample'[Sales Amount] < LowerBound,
        "Anomaly", "Normal"
    )
```

###  2. Financial Trend Analysis

####  Business Problem
To enable **data-driven decision-making** by tracking financial performance trends over time and optimizing:
- ** Revenue Growth Strategies**
- ** Discount Optimization**
- ** Customer Segment Profitability**

####  Key Findings
- ** Discounts negatively impact overall profit margins.**
- ** Sales show seasonal variations, requiring strategy adjustments.**
- ** Enterprise segment shows negative profitability, requiring corrective actions.**

####  DAX Calculations for Key Metrics
#####  Total Sales Calculation
```DAX
Total Sales = SUM('Financial Sample'[Sales Amount])
```
##### Profit Margin Calculation
```DAX
Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales], 0)
```
#####  Discount Impact Analysis
```DAX
Discount Effect = 
VAR AvgDiscount = AVERAGE('Financial Sample'[Discount])
RETURN 
    IF(AvgDiscount > 0.2, "High Discount Impact", "Low Discount Impact")
```

###  3. Time Intelligence Analysis

####  DAX Time Intelligence Calculations for Financial Trends
#####  Year-over-Year (YoY) Sales Growth
```DAX
YoY Sales Growth = 
VAR PriorYearSales = CALCULATE([Total Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
RETURN 
    DIVIDE([Total Sales] - PriorYearSales, PriorYearSales, 0)
```
#####  Month-to-Date (MTD) Sales
```DAX
Sales MTD = TOTALMTD([Total Sales], 'Date'[Date])
```
##### Quarter-to-Date (QTD) Sales
```DAX
Sales QTD = TOTALQTD([Total Sales], 'Date'[Date])
```
#####  Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales
```DAX
Sales YTD = TOTALYTD([Total Sales], 'Date'[Date])
```
##### Cumulative Sales Over Time
```DAX
Cumulative Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales],
    FILTER(
        ALL('Date'),
        'Date'[Date] <= MAX('Date'[Date])
    )
)
```
